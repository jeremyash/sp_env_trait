# Functional trait prediction of species-environment relationships

Code to develop a hierarchical model (linear mixed model) following the framework developed by Pollock, L. J., Morris, W. K., & Vesk, P. A. (2012). The role of functional traits in species distributions revealed through a hierarchical model. Ecography, 35(8), 716â€“725. http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2011.07085.x.  Code is modeled after what Pollock et al. present in their appendix, with attempts at replicating the figures presented in their paper.
